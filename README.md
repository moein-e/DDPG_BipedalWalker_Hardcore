# RL: BipedalWalkerHardcore

Here is my fun side project to train a DDPG agent to learn to walk in the BipedalWalker (Hardcore) environment. 
The environment is obtained from Gym OpenAI: https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2/

I have been using DDPG method and here is the latest trained result:
